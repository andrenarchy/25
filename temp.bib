@article{Gisborne2012a-u,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the claim that definite expressions
involve universal and existential quantification from the point of view
of Word Grammar, in order to establish whether the quantificational view
of definiteness is compatible with a particular cognitive theory of
language, and
to see how it compares with the familiarity treatment of definiteness.
It is argued that the quantificational approach is superior to the
familiarity approach in the analysis of a number of linguistic
phenomena, and a number of Word Grammar analyses are presented. The
paper concludes with
an investigation into the grammaticalization of the English definite
article, in order to compare the merits of the two approaches, and
argues that the quantificational approach delivers a simpler and
preferable account.},

@article{catJLv13-alexiadou,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the variation found with respect to how languages morphologically mark argument structure (AS) alternations, a variation that I take to be related to the realization of the syntactic Voice head. The paper discusses the behavior of dispositional middles and reflexives in languages such as English as opposed to their Greek counterparts. I will pursue the hypothesis that there are three Voice related heads implicated in AS alternations across languages. Active Voice is involved in the structure of all transitive and unergative predicates across languages, which in English subsumes d. middles and reflexives. Passive Voice, which the paper will only briefly touch upon here, takes as an input a transitive structure and gives an English/German/Hebrew type passive. Middle Voice is the non-active counterpart of Kratzer's active Voice and gives rise to reflexives, passives and dispositional middles in Greek type languages.},

@article{Dreyer92a-u,
	Abstract = {This paper reports on the results of a detailed empirical study of word order correlations, based on a sample of 625 languages. The primary result is a determination of exactly what pairs of elements correlate in order with the verb and object. Some pairs of elements that have been claimed to correlate in order with the verb and object do not in fact exhibit any correlation. I argue against the Head-Dependent Theory (HDT), according to which the correlations reflect a tendency towards consistent ordering of heads and dependents. I offer an alternative account, the Branching Direction Theory (BDT), based on consistent ordering of phrasal and nonphrasal elements. According to the BDT, the word order correlations reflect a tendency for languages to be consistently right-branching or consistently left-branching.},
