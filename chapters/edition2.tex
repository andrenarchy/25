\section*{Forword of the second edition}

I want to thank Wang Lulu for pointing out some typos that she found while translating the book to
Chinese. Thanks for both the typos and the translation.

Fritz Hamm noticed that the definition of Intervention was incomplete and pointed out some
inconsistencies in translations of predicates in Section~\ref{sec-PSG-Semantik}.

I turned some straight lines in Chapter~\ref{chap-GB} into triangles.

%Hamm: add Heim/Kratzer, Quantifier-Movement erkl채ren

I extended the discussion of Pirah찾 in Section~\ref{sec-recursion-empirical-problems} and added lexical items that show that
Pirah찾-like modification without recursion can be captured in a straightforward way in Categorial Grammar.
